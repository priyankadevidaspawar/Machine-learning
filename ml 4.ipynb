    "Q1. What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its application?\n",
    "ans. Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale numerical features within a specific range. It transforms the original values of the features into a new range, typically between 0 and 1, based on the minimum and maximum values of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Min-Max scaling, the following formula is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaled Value = (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)\n",

    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Value is the original value of the feature.\n",
    ".Min is the minimum value of the feature in the dataset.\n",
    ".Max is the maximum value of the feature in the dataset.\n",
    "The Min-Max scaling ensures that all the feature values are proportionally adjusted to fit within the desired range. This can be useful in scenarios where features have different scales or ranges, allowing the features to be compared and interpreted on a similar scale. It is particularly beneficial for algorithms that rely on distance calculations or where the magnitude of the features affects the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate the application of Min-Max scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset containing a feature \"Age\" with values ranging from 18 to 60. The goal is to apply Min-Max scaling to rescale these values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Age values: [18, 25, 30, 40, 60]\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Min-Max scaling, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the Age feature in the dataset. In this case, the minimum value is 18, and the maximum value is 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min = 18\n",
    "Max = 60\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use the Min-Max scaling formula to calculate the scaled values for each age:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaled Age values: [(18-18)/(60-18), (25-18)/(60-18), (30-18)/(60-18), (40-18)/(60-18), (60-18)/(60-18)]\n",

    "ans. The Unit Vector technique, also known as Vector normalization, is a feature scaling method that transforms the feature vectors into unit vectors, where each vector has a magnitude of 1. It rescales the feature values based on their vector norms, ensuring that each feature vector has the same Euclidean length.\n",

    "\n",
    "||Value|| = sqrt(Height^2 + Weight^2)\n",

    "For the first feature vector (170, 65), the Euclidean norm is calculated as:\n",

    "||Value1|| = sqrt(170^2 + 65^2) = 183.423\n",

    "||Value2|| = 193.649\n",

    "Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an example to illustrate its application?\n",
    "ans. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space.
